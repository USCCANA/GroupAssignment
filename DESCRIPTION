Title: Minimum Cost Group Matching Implementation
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Hemant Kunda
Maintainer: Hemant Kunda <hkunda@usc.edu>
Description: Finds the optimal matching of members to groups across all possible groups
    using a C++ implementation of the Hungarian algorithm for minimum cost perfect matching. Users can 
    specify a ranking matrix (where each row corresponds to a member within the group, and each column
    corresponds to a spot on any ranking) and receive the best overall group assignments based on these rankings.
